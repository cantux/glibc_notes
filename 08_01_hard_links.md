### Hard Links

In POSIX systems, one file can have many names at the same time. All of the names are equally real, and no one of them is preferred to the others. 

To add a name to a file, use the link function. Creating a new link to a file does not copy the contents of the file; it simply makes a new name by which the file can be known.
