#### Ports

Socket address in the internet namespace consists of a machine;s Internet addresss + a **port** number, which distingushes sockets on a given machine.

Port numbers range from 0 to 65K. 2 bytes.

Port numbers less IPPORT_RESERVED are reserved for dstandard servers such as **finger** nad **telnet**. There is a database to keep track of these.

If you write a server that is not one of the standard ones defined in the database, you must choose a port number for it. Use a number greater than IPPORT_USERRESERVED; such numbers are reserved for servers and will not ever be generated automatically by the system.

When you use a socket without specifying its address, the system generates a port number for it. This number is between IPPORT_RESERVED and IPPORT_USERRESERVED. 

You can use getservbyname function to map a service name onto a port number. See Services Database

On internet it is actually legitemate to have two different sockets with the same port number, as long as they never both try to communicate with the same socket address(host number + port number).
One should not duplicate port number except in special circumstances where a higher-level protocol requres it. 

Normally, the system will not let you use same port numbers. **bind()** insists on distinct port numbers. To reuse a port number, one must set the socket option *SO_REUSEADDR*.
See Socket-Level Options.
