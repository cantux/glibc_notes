#### The **inetd** Daemon

We have shown above how a server program that does its own listening. Such a server must already be running in order for anyone to connect to it.

Another way to provide a service on an Internet port is to let the daemon program **inetd** do the listening.

**inetd** is a program that runs all the time and waits (using **select**) for messages on a specified set of ports.

When it receives a message it accepts the connection and then forks a child process to run the corresponfing server program.

You specify the ports and their programs in the file /etc/inetd.conf.

##### inetd Servers                 

Each time someone requests a connection to the appropriate port, a new server process starts.

The connection already exists at this time.

The socket is available as the standard input descriptor and as the standard output descriptor (descriptors 0 and 1) in the server process.

Thus the server program can begin reading and writing data right away. Often the program needs only the ordinary I/O facilities; 
in fact, a general-purpose filter program that knows nothing about sockets can work as a byte stream server run by inetd. 

You can also use inetd for servers that use connectionless communication styles. 
For these servers, inetd does not try to accept a connection since no connection is possible. 
It just starts the server program, which can read the incoming datagram packet from descriptor 0. 
The server program can handle one request and then exit, or you can choose to write it to keep reading more requests until no more arrive, and then exit. 
You must specify which of these two techniques the server uses when you configure inetd. 

##### Configuring inetd

The file /etc/inetd.conf tells inetd which ports to listen to and what server programs to run for them.

Ex: 

- ftp               stream      tcp             nowait      root        /libexec/ftpd       ftpd
- talk              dgram       udp             wait        root        /libexec/talkd      talkd

- service           style       protocol        wait        username    program             arguments
- /etc/services     SOCK_       /etc/protocol               

Use 'wait' if style is a connectionless style and the server, once started, handles multiple requests as they come in. 

Use 'nowait' if inetd should start a new process for each message or request that comes in. If style uses connections, then wait must be 'nowait'.
