## Some history

Starts with Multics, a collaboration project between multiple groups. Had all the good ideas but eventually blobbed and failed.

AT&T Bell Labs still liked the idea and they designed a new filesystem. Then added an assembler, shell, process management and basic I/O --> UNIX!

C was developed to facilitate UNIX. C's and UNIX' success seems like a chicken and egg problem to me. Together they created an ecosystem. 

Hardware developers adopted it. Standards emerged, ANSI C, IEEE POSIX, endless list of communications protocols supported by low-level I/O interfaces.

AND of course the final nail in the coffin: the positive-feedback loop(applies to any ecosystem) of dependent/convinient software.

Imagine the slimey evolution. Life-like emergence of the modern computer similar to self replicating crystals to DNA.

Innovation: PIPES(orgasmic noises) Though it is more organic then it sounds-as with everything-. 

Hmm, now how could one come up with this sort of a facility? Given that programs should have low coupling. "Take over where I finish, oh and we like linebreaks" --> Developers just needed their programs to be able to communicate with each other.
